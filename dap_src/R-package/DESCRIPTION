Description: An implementations of structured Bayesian model selection via adaptive deterministic approximation of posteriors (DAP) algorithm.
   Applications include genetic association analysis integrating genomic annotations. 
   These methods are designed to perform rigorous enrichment analysis, QTL discovery and multi-SNP fine-mapping analysis in a highly efficient way.
